# hello-world
This is my First Time on Github and the very first Repository.
I just completed my MCA from Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra.
Shifted to Mumbai (Bombay) for the Job. Got Selected here in a Company.
Started as an Intern and Now Become a Graduate Trainee.
I heard there is no Limit of Study and in the Ara if you want to Live you have to Survive with lots of changed. Now, if you are versatile you are best. So, decided with the help of mentor step ahead toward career.
